3a. Morse Code is a system for representing alphanumeric characters as a series of dots, dashes, and spaces. It's a method of nonverbal communication, using electrical pulses, visible light, or other mechanical means to transmit a message encoded in Morse Code. Dots represent short "HIGH" signals, dashes represent longer "HIGH" signals, and spaces represent "LOW" signals.

3b. Morse Code was developed by Samual F.B. Morse in the 1830s, which was later refined to meet an international standard by a group of European nations in the 1850s.
