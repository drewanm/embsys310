Another embedded device could be an airbag deployment system in a car. It probably works using an accelerometer to detect rapid changes in velocity, quantifying the force and determining whether or not to deploy the airbags. The airbags would be deployed with a signal from the embedded system's microcontroller. The microcontroller would also do the analysis of the accelerometer's data, which it would read from the accelerometer probably through a simple communication protocol like SPI or I2C.

The design challenges present in this embedded device / system are many. For one, the micro must be able to process all the accelerometer data. Timing is also critical; since it can be responsible for saving passengers' lives, it must respond quickly or else airbags going off after a crash are obviously ineffective at saving someone's life. It must be reliable, since a faulty airbag system that goes off randomly or not at all is dangerous. It must be free of errors and free from tampering, and must be testable to the point that it is nearly 100% reliable. Power consumption probably is not an issue, and if the program size proves to be big, then memory space would be a challenge. Cost likely is not a factor since safety of the passengers is the number one priority.
