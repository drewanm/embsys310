Two's complement is primarily used mostly due to the fact that arithmetic operations done on numbers in two's complement can be done without modifying the numbers operated on. For example, adding or subtracting two numbers represented in two's complement, whether or not they are negative, will produce the correct result without any extra bit modifications. This translates to simpler software and simpler hardware.
